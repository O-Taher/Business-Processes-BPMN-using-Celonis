The project titled "Emissions Analytics" was conducted by myself and my group.

Our project aimed to optimize transportation methods to reduce emissions and improve efficiency, as well as identify and mitigate emissions from vendors and seasonal variations. We formulated several hypotheses and questions to guide our research process.

Through data analysis, we employed various techniques such as regression analysis, cluster analysis, and time series analysis. Regression analysis helped us identify the relationship between variables such as transportation mode and emissions, while cluster analysis allowed us to group vendors based on their emission levels. Time series analysis helped us examine the seasonality patterns in emissions data over time.

To calculate emissions associated with transportation modes and vendors, we used established emission calculation methodologies such as carbon footprinting. These methodologies considered factors such as distance traveled, fuel consumption, and vehicle efficiency. We also took into account specific emission factors for different transportation modes, such as CO2 emissions per KG for air transportation and CO2 emissions per KG for sea shipments.

Using the Celonis software, we created a comprehensive dashboard to present the data and insights generated from the project. This software provided process mining capabilities, allowing us to visualize and analyze the end-to-end supply chain processes. By analyzing event logs and process data, we gained insights into process inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement.

We utilized advanced data visualization techniques to communicate our findings effectively. This included generating charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI. Visualizing the data helped stakeholders identify key insights and patterns at a glance.

Based on our analysis, we made recommendations to optimize transportation mode selection using Celonis, which helped us identify the most efficient combination of transportation modes based on factors such as cost, emissions, and delivery time. We also considered sustainability metrics beyond emissions, such as the environmental impact of packaging materials and resource efficiency.

In conclusion, we analyzed emissions from supply chain processes across 2000 orders using various data analysis techniques and the Celonis software. Our findings included substantial disparities in emissions between transportation modes, variations in vendor emissions, fluctuations in emissions across seasons, and identified undesired activities contributing to excess emissions. By implementing our recommendations to optimize transportation, partner with efficient vendors, reduce undesired activities, and enhance monitoring during peak seasons, we aimed to create a more sustainable supply chain.
